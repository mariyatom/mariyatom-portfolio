            Hi, Iâ€™m Mariya - a full-stack developer who speaks both frontend
            sass and backend logic. I recently graduated from Dev Academy
            Aotearoa (NZQA Level 6).
          </p>
          <p>
            My tech journey started with an Electronics and Communications
            Engineering degree, and since then, Iâ€™ve worn many hats from
            building a food ordering system for St. Pierreâ€™s Sushi in New
            Zealand (as part of a remote team in India), using Spring Boot,
            Angular, and MySQL, to modernizing COBOL systems in Japan (yes, that
            dinosaur still roars ðŸ¦–).
          </p>
          <p>
            Now in Aotearoa, Iâ€™m back in tech with fire for creative
            problem-solving. Iâ€™m passionate about building smart, simple digital
            solutions that make life just a bit easier. Letâ€™s build cool stuff
            together!
          </p>
