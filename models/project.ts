    description: `Our app is centered on New Zealand's 11 Great Walks. our team of 6 members created a React web app that lists all great walks.During this project, I got to explore both frontend and backend development. I spent the first few days deep in the backend before switching to the frontend and honestly, that‚Äôs when I found my stride.

It felt like working on a car engine hidden away but vital, powering everything from behind the scenes. That‚Äôs where all the logic lives, and I really enjoyed getting stuck into that part.

This app let users see at a glance what gear they already had and what they still needed to prepare for their chosen walk.

üîê Keeping Things Secure
We used Auth0 as our login system a kind of virtual bouncer that ensures only logged-in users can view or update their personal info. We implemented this security on both frontend and backend through pair programming.

    description: `Big Mart was a solo mini-project. I‚Äôm developing this app for my father-in-law‚Äôs retail shop in Auckland. It‚Äôs a well-established store with over 15 years of history, especially focused on South Indian foods.

During our foundation phase and the 20-hour project time, I first started thinking about this app. But due to time and knowledge limitations at that point, I pivoted and created a small book site for toddlers instead called Lil Book Shop, built using JavaScript.

However, the moment I heard about the chance to do a personal project, my mind instantly leaned toward creating an e-commerce website for our family‚Äôs shop without a second thought.

What motivated me even more was the freedom of not having to build a finished product. With that flexibility, I decided to move ahead with this app idea, building my own MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and designing the database from scratch.`,

    When a task is marked as "Completed", it initially remains visible in the "All" list. Upon clicking the "Clear Completed" button, it is removed from the "All" list and moved to the "Completed" tab. The task's status is also updated in the database.

If the "Delete" button is clicked, the task is permanently removed.
